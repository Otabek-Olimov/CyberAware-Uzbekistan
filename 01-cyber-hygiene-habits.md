 just like brushing your teeth keeps you healthy, being good at cyber stuff keeps your online life safe In Uzbekistan, where kids are glued to their screens all day for school, socializing, or games, sticking to some easy daily routines can seriously up their safety game.



1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords
 don't use your name, birthday, or "
56" as your password. Hackers can just figure out weak passwords without much trouble.

 when you're making a super strong password, mix up all sorts of characters like letters, numbers, and symbols to keep it tough to crack if you're struggling to keep track of your passwords, just use a password manager to help you out



2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
 even if someone gets your password, having that extra step of 2FA is like adding another lock to your door. it's like getting a secret code on your phone or app

 Hey, don't forget to turn on that extra security thingy (2FA) for all your key accounts - like your email, Instagram, Telegram, and banking stuff.

 clicking on dodgy links or downloading sketchy stuff can get you a virus or have your info stolen

 just don't click on stuff from random places, it's not worth the risk if you hover over a link, you can see where it's actually taking you before you click on it.



5. Be Careful What You Share Online

 Talking too much online can get you into trouble like bullying, stealing your identity, or even more serious stuff.

6. Log Out and Lock Your Devices

Leaving your account or computer open is like leaving your house door unlocked.
