# The Importance of Cybersecurity in Our Daily Lives

In this highly connected age, cybersecurity turns out to be a crucial factor in daily life. Every online activity is fraught with some kind of risk, from entering your email, doing your online banking, talking on social media, or buying an item from another person via an e-commerce portal. Without a cybersecurity awareness and protection, we can be vulnerable to identity theft, data breaches, and tapping of finances.

Cybersecurity goes for the safeguarding of systems, networks, and data from any digital attacks. Such attacks are usually meant for accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or disrupting normal business processes. The more the computers and devices are connected to each other through the internet, the more are the opportunities for cybercriminals.

For students and young-age users, an understanding of cybersecurity becomes very important. This particular segment of young users is found rather very active on the internet for studying, and for entertainment and communication. Yet, many of these users are unaware of how to distinguish a phishing scam, a fake website, or a dangerous download. Hence, simple cybersecurity habits need to be taught and inculcated in their behavior, such as choosing strong passwords, using two-factor-authentication (2FA), etc.
